# LinkedIn Post Draft - Bradán Launch

**Managing multiple workstreams with AI**

Between work at Shopify and running a business on the side, I was spending 15-20 minutes every morning on the same routine: checking my calendar, scanning Slack and email, writing out my daily plan, creating meeting note files.

It was tedious but necessary. Until I automated it.

I built **Bradán** (Irish for "salmon" - nod to the Salmon of Knowledge) - an AI-powered assistant that lives in Cursor IDE.

Every morning, one command: `"Good morning"`

It automatically:
• Pulls my Google Calendar
• Generates a daily file with Top 3 priorities
• Creates meeting note stubs with attendees and links
• Prioritizes my email and Slack messages
• Carries forward incomplete tasks from yesterday

Friday afternoons: `"Archive this week"`

It extracts my weekly accomplishments from my daily files, prompts me with 3 reflection questions, and archives everything. What used to take 45 minutes of manual review now takes 5.

Since getting the system working properly in October, I've saved roughly **23 hours** - 15 minutes per day on planning plus 40 minutes per week on reviews.

The best part? It's all local markdown files. No cloud vendor. No subscription. Portable and version-controlled.

Open sourcing it today if you're looking for a better way to stay on top of multiple projects.
