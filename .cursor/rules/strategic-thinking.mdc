# Strategic Thinking Patterns

## Core Approach

### Systems Architect Mindset
- **Design frameworks** others execute
- **Build systems** not one-offs
- **Think in patterns** and reusable structures
- **Anticipate future** - "connecting dots forward"

### Framework Thinking
- **Create reusable structures** - design for scalability
- **Document patterns** - capture what works
- **Build compensating systems** - acknowledge gaps, create solutions
- **Think big picture** - strategic scope over tactical execution

## Work Philosophy

### "Design the System, Let Others Execute"
- **Architect role** - design how it should work
- **Not executor** - others handle structured delivery
- **Strategic focus** - big picture thinking
- **Partnership model** - work with execution-strong people

### Context Requirements
- **Full context needed** - requires big picture before action
- **Background included** - extensive rationale and history
- **Explicit connections** - show how ideas relate
- **Question-driven** - often leads with questions to explore

## Documentation Approach

### Memory Bank Philosophy
- **Document for future self** - assume memory resets
- **Comprehensive context** - include full background
- **Explicit connections** - show how pieces relate
- **Decision rationale** - explain why, not just what

### Living Documents
- **Update as context evolves** - documents are living
- **Version awareness** - note when major updates occur
- **Status tracking** - keep current state visible
- **Archive completed** - move to archive when done

## Strategic Patterns

### "Connecting Dots Forward"
- **Anticipate future patterns** - see where things are heading
- **Pattern recognition** - identify recurring themes
- **Systems thinking** - understand interconnections
- **Strategic foresight** - think ahead of current state

### Framework Design
- **Reusable structures** - create templates and patterns
- **Scalable systems** - design for growth
- **Compensating structures** - build systems to address gaps
- **Outcome-focused** - always include success criteria

## Work Style Implications

### What Eamon Needs
- **Strategic problems** - not tactical execution
- **Autonomy** - big picture scope, not micromanagement
- **Execution partners** - compensate for structure gaps
- **External accountability** - deadlines, check-ins
- **Systems and templates** - impose structure externally

### What Eamon Brings
- **Strategic foresight** - pattern recognition
- **Systems architecture** - framework design
- **Leadership** - team development
- **Innovation** - transformation thinking
- **Calm under ambiguity** - handles change well

## Communication Patterns

### Question-Driven Exploration
- **Lead with questions** - explore before prescribing
- **Context gathering** - understand fully before acting
- **Pattern identification** - recognize recurring themes
- **Strategic discussion** - deep analysis over tactical updates

### Comprehensive Context
- **Full background** - extensive history and rationale
- **Explicit connections** - show how ideas relate
- **Framework presentation** - structure as reusable pattern
- **Outcome focus** - always include success criteria

## Decision-Making Patterns

### Filter Through Priorities
- **Strategic lens** - does this align with vision?
- **Systems lens** - does this create leverage?
- **Merchant lens** - does this help merchants succeed?
- **Operational lens** - does this create clarity?

### Framework Application
- **Reusable structures** - apply proven patterns
- **Scalable design** - build for growth
- **Compensating systems** - address known gaps
- **Outcome measurement** - define success criteria

## Collaboration Style

### Partnership Model
- **Execution-strong partners** - compensate for structure gaps
- **Strategic + Tactical** - Eamon thinks, partner executes
- **Autonomy respected** - no micromanagement
- **Systems support** - external structure and accountability

### Cross-Functional Thinking
- **Bridge disciplines** - SE, RevOps, Sales, CSM
- **Merchant-focused** - prioritize merchant success
- **Innovation-driven** - challenge status quo
- **Transformation-oriented** - reimagine, not just optimize
