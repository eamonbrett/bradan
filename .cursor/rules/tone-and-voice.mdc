# Tone & Voice Guide

## Core Voice Principles

### Irish Pragmatism
- **Practical and grounded** - no dramatic urgency language
- **Realistic timelines** - no false urgency
- **Calm, assured tone** - confident without being press release-like
- **Avoid American-style urgency:** Never use "CRITICAL", "HIGH PRIORITY", "🔴", "⚠️" for non-emergencies
- **Tech work is never critical** - use: important, relevant, ongoing, pending, outstanding

### Language Patterns
- ✅ **Use:** "important", "relevant", "ongoing", "pending", "outstanding"
- ❌ **Never use:** "CRITICAL", "HIGH PRIORITY", "urgent" (unless literally life-threatening)
- ✅ **Use:** "This needs attention" vs "This is CRITICAL"
- ✅ **Use:** "Let's prioritize this" vs "This is HIGH PRIORITY"

## Audience Awareness

### Executive Level (VP, Director, Managing Director)
**Examples:** Deann Evans, Andre Lyver

**Characteristics:**
- **Length:** <100 lines (aim for 60-80)
- **Reading time:** 2-minute scan
- **Style:** Strategic summaries, high-level outcomes
- **Detail:** Link to external resources (Vault, Google Docs)
- **Format:** Simple tables, clear ownership, bottom-line summaries
- **Tone:** Confident, concise, results-focused

**What to include:**
- Current status and outcomes
- Clear ownership
- Links to detailed resources
- Bottom-line summary (1 sentence)

**What to exclude:**
- Detailed tactical information
- Step-by-step processes
- Granular metrics (unless critical)
- Long explanations of "how"

### Manager/Lead Level
**Examples:** Fabian Muessig, Olivia Rossetti, Marta Encuentra

**Characteristics:**
- **Length:** 100-200 lines
- **Reading time:** 5-10 minutes
- **Style:** Strategic context + tactical details
- **Detail:** Key context embedded, some external links
- **Format:** Sections with context, reasoning, actionable items
- **Tone:** Collaborative, informative, solution-oriented

### IC/Collaborator Level
**Examples:** Christen Stroh, Ben Homer, Stephen Brook

**Characteristics:**
- **Length:** 200+ lines as needed
- **Reading time:** 15-30 minutes
- **Style:** Actionable, detailed, execution-focused
- **Detail:** Full context embedded (minimize link-clicking)

- **Tone:** Clear, helpful, thorough

**What to include:**
- Full context and background
- Specific next actions with timelines
- Explicit ownership for each item

## Communication Preferences

### Written Over Verbal
- **Thinks through writing** - documentation-heavy approach
- **Async-friendly** - structured documents for async consumption
- **Strategic discussion** - prefers deep analysis over tactical updates
- **Direct feedback** - not conflict-avoidant, appreciates honesty

### Context Requirements
- **Full context needed** - requires big picture before action
- **Background included** - extensive rationale and history
- **Explicit connections** - show how ideas relate
- **Question-driven** - often leads with questions to explore

### Self-Awareness
- **Acknowledges limitations** - openly discusses gaps and needs
- **Compensation strategies** - explains how to work with limitations
- **Partnership model** - recognizes need for execution-strong partners
- **Systems thinking** - builds external structures to compensate

## Positive Without Overdoing

### Tone Guidelines
- **Confident but not press release-like**
- **Positive without being overly American**
- **Practical and assured**
- **No corporate speak or buzzwords**
- **Grounded in reality**

### Example Contrasts
- ❌ "We're thrilled to announce this game-changing initiative!"
- ✅ "This initiative addresses a key gap in our process."

- ❌ "This is a critical priority that requires immediate attention!"
- ✅ "This is important and needs attention this week."

## Link Accessibility

### Always Verify Links
- ✅ **Use:** Vault pages, Google Docs/Drive, Fellow notes, Figma, company-accessible links
- ❌ **Never use:** Local workspace file paths (e.g., `work/projects/file.md`)
- **If no public link exists:** Note "Available from [Owner] if needed"

### Link Strategy by Audience
- **Executive:** Links for drill-down detail
- **IC:** Embed context directly (minimize link-clicking)
